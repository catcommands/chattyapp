# About Chatty-App Project
Chatty allows users to communicate with each other without having to register accounts. It uses React, a popular front-end library created and used heavily by Facebook as well as modern tools for Node including Webpack and Babel.
- When any connected user sends a chat message, all connected users receive and display the message
- When any connected user changes their name, all connected users are notified of the name change.
- Every notification (messages or change of username) has a unique id which can be seen inside cmd.
- Header will display the count of connected users
- When the number of connected users changes, this count will be updated for all connected users.



# Incognito Mode
This ChattApp also works with incognito mode.
